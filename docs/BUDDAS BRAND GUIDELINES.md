# **Buddas Hawaiian Brand Guidelines (2025 Edition)**

Identity System: "Modern Aloha"  
Version: 2.9 (ROAS & Attribution Added)  
Status: Active

## **1\. Brand Strategy & Story**

### **The Core Mission**

To Bring Aloha to the Table.  
We exist to share the specific warmth of island-inspired comfort food—fast, consistent, and family-friendly. We believe that convenience shouldn't feel cold, and speed shouldn't cost you your wallet.

### **The Brand Story**

In a world of transactional fast food and faceless delivery apps, **Buddas is the warm hug.** We are the spot where the steam rises off the rice, the mac salad is always creamy, and the "Aloha" isn't just a marketing slogan—it's the way we treat every order. We took the classic Hawaiian plate lunch—generous, flavorful, humble—and engineered it for the modern family on the go.

### **Positioning: "Premium-Casual"**

We sit in the sweet spot between "Fast Food" and "Casual Dining."

* **Faster than a sit-down restaurant.** (Tech-enabled ordering).  
* **Higher quality than a drive-thru.** (Fresh ingredients, real cooking).  
* **More soul than a corporate chain.** (Warmth, community, flavor).

### **Target Audience: "The Busy Provider"**

**Who they are:**

* **Busy Families:** Parents who want a "real dinner" on a Tuesday night without cooking.  
* **Working Pros:** Office workers who need a lunch that is filling, fast, and high-quality.  
* **The "Homesick" Local:** People craving the specific taste of home (Musubi, Katsu, Teri).

**Key Occasions:**

1. **The Lunch Rush:** 11:30 AM \- 1:30 PM. Needs speed. "Order ahead, pickup in 5."  
2. **The Family Dinner:** 5:00 PM \- 7:30 PM. Needs volume and value. "Feed the whole crew."  
3. **The Office Hero:** Catering orders. "Be the person who brought the good food."

### **Core Promises (USPs)**

1. **Flavor & Freshness:** We don't cut corners on the marinade. The Katsu is crisp. The rice is hot.  
2. **Modern Convenience:** Our tech works. Ordering is frictionless. Pickup is ready when we say it is.  
3. **Honest Value:** Real portions for a fair price. You leave full.

## **2\. Verbal Identity: The Voice of Buddas**

Because our visual identity is modern and geometric, our **Verbal Identity** must provide the warmth.

### **A. Voice & Tone Guidelines**

Our voice is **Warm, Honest, and Efficient.** We speak like a friendly local, not a corporate bot.

#### **The "Aloha Filter" (Do's and Don'ts)**

| Scenario | ❌ Don't Say (Too Corporate/Cold) | ❌ Don't Say (Too Cliche/Cheesy) | ✅ DO Say (The Buddas Voice) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Menu Description** | "Grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce and rice." | "The most amazing chicken that will make you hula\!" | "Char-grilled chicken glazed in house teri sauce. Served over steaming jasmine rice." |
| **Promo Email** | "Buy one get one free on Musubi today only." | "Aloha friends\! Get your tiki on with free Spam\!" | "Two hands, two Musubis. BOGO free all day today." |
| **Error Message** | "System Error 503\. Try again later." | "Uh oh, the volcano erupted\!" | "Whoops. Our system went surfing. Let's try that again." |
| **Late Night** | "Open until 10 PM." | "Party all night island style\!" | "Late night cravings? We're firing up the grill 'til 10 PM." |

### **B. Messaging Pillars & Taglines**

#### **Pillar 1: Freshness & Quality ("The Crave")**

* *Key Concept:* Real food, cooked fresh. Not sitting under a heat lamp for hours.  
* *Taglines:*  
  * "Island-fresh comfort."  
  * "Steaming rice. Crisp Katsu. Real Aloha."  
  * "Cooked with heart, served with speed."

#### **Pillar 2: Convenience & Speed ("The Modern")**

* *Key Concept:* We respect your time. High-tech ordering, high-touch service.  
* *Taglines:*  
  * "Order now, pickup fast."  
  * "Skip the line, keep the Aloha."  
  * "Dinner solved in 3 taps."

#### **Pillar 3: Generosity & Value ("The Ohana")**

* *Key Concept:* You get fed properly. No tiny portions.  
* *Taglines:*  
  * "Bring Aloha to the table."  
  * "Feed the whole crew."  
  * "Plates that hit. Prices that don't."

### **C. Sample Scripts (Staff & Support)**

Standardizing these ensures the brand voice is heard, not just read.

#### **In-Store Greeting (The "Welcome")**

* **Goal:** Acknowledge the guest immediately (within 5 seconds).  
* **Script:** "Welcome in\! Picking up or ordering fresh?"  
  * *Why:* It’s active. It solves the traffic flow problem (Pickup vs. Order) immediately while sounding friendly.

#### **Phone Answer (The "Efficiency")**

* **Goal:** Answer fast, give info, take order.  
* **Script:** "Mahalo for calling Buddas on \[Street Name\]. This is \[Name\]. Can I start a pickup order for you?"  
  * *Why:* "Mahalo" sets the tone. Stating the location prevents "Is this the one on X street?" questions. Asking "Can I start a pickup order?" steers them to revenue immediately.

#### **Problem Resolution (The "Fix")**

* **Scenario:** Guest is missing an item.  
* **Script:** "I am so sorry we missed that. I’m going to fire a fresh one up for you right now. Do you have 3 minutes to wait, or would you prefer a refund?"  
  * *Why:* Own it ("I am sorry"). Fix it ("Fire a fresh one"). Give agency ("Wait or Refund").

#### **Online Chat / DM Reply**

* **Scenario:** Guest asks "Are you open?"  
* **Script:** "We sure are\! Firing up the grills until 9 PM tonight. Come through or order ahead at \[Link\]."

## **3\. Visual Identity (Beyond Basics)**

### **A. Photography Direction: "Appetite Appeal with Soul"**

Since our fonts are clean (Poppins), our photos must provide the texture, heat, and "messiness" of real food.

#### **1\. Lighting & Tone**

* **Golden Hour:** Light should feel like 4:00 PM sun coming through a window. Warm, directional, slightly hard shadows (but not harsh).  
* **No Blue Tones:** Avoid cold/clinical lighting. White rice should look creamy/warm, not blue-white.  
* **Highlight Control:** Highlights on sauces (Teriyaki, Katsu) should look "glossy and wet," not "greasy and white."

#### **2\. Plating & Framing**

* **The "Generosity" Crop:** Crop in tight. The food should feel like it's bursting out of the frame. We sell abundance.  
* **The "Perfectly Imperfect" Plate:**  
  * *Do:* Show a little sauce drip on the rice. Show a stray green onion.  
  * *Don't:* Use tweezers to make it look like a museum piece. It’s comfort food.  
* **Angles:**  
  * *45-Degree (The Diner's Eye):* Best for Bentos and Plates. Shows depth and volume.  
  * *Top-Down (The Flat Lay):* Use for spreads (Family Meals, Catering trays) to show variety.

#### **3\. Props & Backgrounds**

* **Surfaces:** Natural wood, matte stone, or our branded "Cream" color. No shiny plastic tables.  
* **Human Element:** Hands are essential. A hand holding a Musubi, a hand pouring sauce, a blurry figure in the background. It signals "made by humans for humans."

### **B. Illustration & Iconography Rules**

* **Style:** Monoline, Rounded Caps.  
* **Weight:** Match the stroke weight to the font weight (Medium/SemiBold).  
* **Color:** Use **Base Teal** for primary icons, **Gold** for accents/stars.  
* **Subject:** Focus on clear, functional icons (Bag, Clock, Car, Utensils). Avoid abstract "decorations."

### **C. Motion & Animation Rules ("Aloha Motion")**

* **Easing:** All motion must use a "Soft Ease-Out" curve (cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)). It should feel like a wave settling, not a robot stopping.  
* **Duration:**  
  * *UI Interactions:* Fast (200ms \- 300ms). Snappy but smooth.  
  * *Menu Board Loops:* Slow (5s \- 8s). Subtle steam rising, sauce glistening. No frantic cuts.  
* **Physics:**  
  * *Food Movement:* Food does not bounce like rubber. It lands with weight.  
  * *Liquids/Steam:* Move slowly and organically.

## **4\. Menu, Packaging & In-Store**

### **A. Menu Engineering (The "High-Yield" Layout)**

We design menus to drive revenue, not just list items.

#### **1\. The "Golden Triangle" Rule (Dine-In/Board)**

* **Center/Right:** Place high-margin signatures (Bentos) here. The eye goes here first.  
* **Top Left:** "New & Limited Time."  
* **Bottom Left:** Lower margin items (Drinks, Sides).  
* **Decoy Pricing:** Place the most expensive item (e.g., "The Big Kahuna Combo") at the top. It makes the standard Bento look like a great deal.

#### **2\. Digital Menu & Kiosk**

* **Visuals:** Every single item must have a photo. No exceptions. Photos increase conversion by 20%+.  
* **Upsell Logic:**  
  * *Trigger:* When adding a Plate.  
  * *Prompt:* "Make it a Combo?" (Drink \+ Cookie).  
  * *Avoid:* Don't ask for "Extra Rice" first. Ask for the high-dollar add-on first.

### **B. Packaging Standards**

Our packaging is a walking billboard. It must look premium but cost-effective.

#### **1\. Paper Bags & Boxes (The "Teal Flood")**

* **Base Color:** Flood coat in **Base Teal (\#54BFA5)**.  
* **Ink Rule:**  
  * **Primary:** High-Opacity White Ink. Used for Logo and Tagline ("Bring Aloha to the Table").  
  * **Secondary (Subtle):** Dark Teal (\#1C5F56) for patterns or social handles.  
  * **Forbidden:** Gold or Orange ink on Teal bags (Low contrast).

#### **2\. Cups & Wraps (White Base)**

* **Base Color:** White paper/plastic.  
* **Ink Rule:**  
  * **Pattern:** Use the "Tapa/Leaf" pattern in **Pale Teal (\#E3F3F3)** at 20% scale.  
  * **Logo:** Base Teal (\#54BFA5) or Dark Brown (\#5A3A1F).  
* **Sustainability Note:** All rigid packaging must be recyclable or compostable where municipal facilities exist. Avoid black plastic (hard to recycle).

### **C. In-Store Applications (The "Flow")**

Signage allows the store to run fast.

#### **1\. Zoning Hierarchy**

* **Zone 1: The Beacon (Exterior).** Illuminated Channel Letters. **White** faces, **Teal** returns (sides). Visible from the street.  
* **Zone 2: The Decision (Menu Board).** High contrast. **Dark Brown** text on **Cream** background for lunch (readability).  
* **Zone 3: The Handoff (Pickup Shelf).** Must be clearly marked "Mobile Pickup" in **Teal** with **White** text. This reduces line anxiety.

#### **2\. Window Graphics**

* **Rule:** Do not block the view of the kitchen/dining room. We want people to see the warmth inside.  
* **Execution:** Vinyl cut lettering in **White**. "Order Online / Pickup Fast" at eye level. Avoid full window wraps that make the store look closed.

#### **3\. Uniforms**

* **Crew:** **Heather Grey** or **Cream** T-Shirts. "Aloha Crew" on back in **Teal**. Friendly, casual.  
* **Kitchen:** **Black** or **Dark Brown** Aprons (hides stains).  
* **Caps:** **Base Teal** dad hats with embroidered Gold logo.

## **5\. Digital & Marketing (The Growth Engine)**

### **A. UI Patterns & Interface Design**

Developers and designers must use these pre-defined components. No guessing.

#### **1\. Button Hierarchy (The "Click Me" System)**

* **Primary (Conversion):** "Order Now", "Checkout".  
  * **Background:** Base Teal (\#54BFA5).  
  * **Text:** Pure White (\#FFFFFF), DM Sans Medium.  
  * **Radius:** 8px.  
* **Secondary (Navigation):** "View Menu", "Edit Item".  
  * **Background:** Transparent.  
  * **Border:** 2px Solid Base Teal.  
  * **Text:** Base Teal (\#54BFA5).  
* **Accent (Add-ons):** "Add \+$1.99".  
  * **Background:** Island Gold (\#E9C559).  
  * **Text:** Dark Brown (\#5A3A1F) – *High contrast mandatory.*

#### **2\. Cards & Modules**

* **The Menu Card:**  
  * **Image:** Top (Mobile) or Left (Desktop). 1:1 or 4:3 Aspect Ratio. Rounded corners (12px).  
  * **Title:** Poppins SemiBold, Dark Brown. Max 2 lines.  
  * **Desc:** DM Sans Regular, Dark Brown (opacity 80%). Max 3 lines.  
  * **Price:** Poppins Medium, Island Gold.  
* **Reward State (Gamification):**  
  * **Progress Bar:** Track points using **Island Gold**.  
  * **Success State:** When a reward is unlocked, use a **Confetti Animation** (Lottie file) and a **Base Teal** success message.

### **B. Online Ordering & 3PD Presence**

Your digital storefront (DoorDash, UberEats, Google) is as important as your physical one.

#### **1\. Menu Naming Convention**

* **Rule:** Adjective \+ Noun \+ \[Key Identifier\].  
* *Bad:* "Katsu."  
* *Good:* "Crispy Chicken Katsu Bento."  
* *Why:* Improves searchability and appetite appeal.

#### **2\. Google Business Profile (GBP)**

* **Description:** Must start with "Island-fresh comfort." Mention "Lunch," "Dinner," and "Catering" in the first 100 characters.  
* **Q\&A:** Pre-populate with: "Do you cater?" "Yes, we offer party pans for any size group."  
* **Photos:** Upload 3 new "Official" photos per month. Delete/Flag low-quality user photos (blurry, dark).

#### **3\. Review Response Protocol**

* **5-Star:** "Mahalo \[Name\]\! Glad the \[Item Mentioned\] hit the spot. See you soon\!"  
* **1-3 Star:** "Aloha \[Name\], I’m sorry we missed the mark on this. We’d love to fix it. Please email us at \[Email\] so we can make it right." (Move conversation offline immediately).

### **C. Social & Campaign System**

A framework to keep the feed looking premium but feeling authentic.

#### **1\. Content Ratios (The 40-30-30 Rule)**

* **40% "Crave" (Brand/Food Porn):** High-quality, close-up shots of food. Focus on steam, sauce, and texture. No text overlays.  
* **30% "Community" (UGC/Culture):** Reposts of guests, photos of the crew, "Behind the Scenes" in the kitchen. Builds trust.  
* **30% "Conversion" (Promo/Sales):** Graphics with text overlays ("BOGO", "New Item"). Hard sell.

#### **2\. Campaign Guardrails**

* **Discount Depth:**  
  * *Standard:* Free Item with Purchase (e.g., "Free Musubi w/ Bento"). Preferable to % off.  
  * *Max Discount:* 20% Off (Friends & Family/Catering).  
  * *Emergency Only:* 50% Off (Grand Openings only). Never devalue the brand with constant deep discounts.  
* **Frequency:** Maximum 1 "Hard Sell" push notification per week. Any more leads to opt-outs.

#### **3\. Attribution & ROAS Tracking (Mandatory)**

We stop guessing. Every campaign must be trackable.

* **The Problem:** Generic codes (e.g., "ALOHA20") make it impossible to know if Facebook, Instagram, or Email is driving sales.  
* **The Rule: Unique Channel Codes.**  
  * **Instagram:** IG20 (or IG\[Name\])  
  * **Facebook:** FB20  
  * **Email:** EM20  
  * **SMS:** TXT20  
  * **Direct Mail:** DM20  
* **Why:** This allows us to export POS data and calculate exact ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) per channel.  
* **Execution:** Create these as separate "Discounts" in SpotOn, even if the value (20%) is the same.

## **6\. Operations & Brand Compliance**

### **A. Service Style & Speed Targets**

The "Brand Promise" is only real if operations deliver it.

#### **1\. Speed of Service (SOS) Goals**

* **In-Store Pickup:** \< 5 Minutes from "Order Placed" to "Handoff" (Lunch Rush).  
* **Delivery Handoff:** Driver wait time \< 2 Minutes. (Drivers who wait, rate poorly).  
* **Table Service (If Applicable):** \< 8 Minutes for Ticket Time.

#### **2\. Queue Design (The Split Flow)**

* **Visual Separation:**  
  * *Left Lane:* **"Order Here"** (For Walk-ins).  
  * *Right Lane/Shelf:* **"Express Pickup"** (For Mobile/Delivery).  
* **Why:** Prevents "Delivery Driver Clutter" from blocking paying guests.

### **B. Brand Compliance Checklist (For Franchisees/Managers)**

A binary "Pass/Fail" audit for any location.

#### **1\. Mandatory (Must Have)**

* \[ \] **Signage:** Exterior channel letters are lit and working. No burnt-out bulbs.  
* \[ \] **Uniforms:** All crew in approved colors (Grey/Cream). No random hoodies or graphic tees.  
* \[ \] **Menu:** Digital boards use the official "Dark Brown on Cream" layout. No handwritten signs taped to the register.  
* \[ \] **Packaging:** All outbound orders in Teal Bags with White Ink. No generic brown bags.

#### **2\. Local Adaptation (Allowed with Approval)**

* \[ \] **Community Board:** Can post local high school sports schedules or flyers (Must be neat, pinned to corkboard, not taped to glass).  
* \[ \] **Decor:** One "Local Flavor" wall allowed (e.g., Surfboard from a local shaper, photo of local landmark). Must be approved by Brand Team.

## **7\. Typography System**

We have moved away from display scripts (Lilita One) to a geometric system that improves readability on kiosks and mobile screens.

### **Primary Font: Poppins**

* **Role:** Headlines, Prices, Navigation, Big Statements.  
* **Why:** Friendly geometry. The circular "o" and open counters feel welcoming but structured.  
* **Technical Note:** Load only **SemiBold (600)** and **Medium (500)**.

### **Secondary Font: DM Sans**

* **Role:** Body copy, Menu descriptions, Modifiers, Buttons.  
* **Why:** It is the open-source twin of Google Sans. It is highly legible at small sizes (perfect for mobile menus).  
* **Technical Note:** Load only **Regular (400)** and **Medium (500)**.

### **Usage Matrix**

| Element | Font Family | Weight | Case | Tracking (Letter Spacing) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **H1 / Hero Headlines** | Poppins | SemiBold (600) | Title Case | \-0.02em (Tight) |
| **H2 / Section Headers** | Poppins | SemiBold (600) | Title Case | \-0.01em |
| **H3 / Prices** | Poppins | Medium (500) | \- | 0 |
| **Body Copy** | DM Sans | Regular (400) | Sentence case | 0 |
| **Buttons / UI Labels** | DM Sans | Medium (500) | Title Case | 0 |
| **Captions / Mods** | DM Sans | Regular (400) | Sentence case | 0 |

**⚠️ CAUTION:** Do not use **Bold (700)** for Poppins Headlines. It becomes too blocky and aggressive. Stick to SemiBold (600).

## **8\. Color Palette (Official)**

This is the strict color system. Do not use unauthorized tints without approval.

### **A. Primary Colors (Brand Anchors)**

* **Base Teal:** \#54BFA5  
  * *Usage:* Primary Buttons, Icons, Key Highlights. The main "Buddas" color.  
* **Dark Teal:** \#1C5F56  
  * *Usage:* Text overlaid on Teal backgrounds, Footer backgrounds, High-contrast headers.  
* **Island Gold:** \#E9C559  
  * *Usage:* Price Badges, "Add to Cart" accents, Star ratings. The "Value" color.

### **B. Neutrals & Canvas**

* **Buddas Cream:** \#FFF8E8  
  * *Usage:* Main Page Backgrounds (The "Rice Paper" canvas). Replaces stark white for a warmer feel.  
* **Cocoa Brown:** \#5A3A1F  
  * *Usage:* **Primary Text Color.** All body copy and dark headlines use this. Never use Black (\#000000).  
* **Pure White:** \#FFFFFF  
  * *Usage:* Inner Cards (to create lift off the Cream background), Input fields.

### **C. Utility Colors**

* **Sunset Orange:** \#D36200  
  * *Usage:* Urgency triggers ("Only 2 left"), Error states, "Limited Time Only" badges. Use sparingly.

### **Color Mapping for Tech (CSS Variables)**

:root {  
  \--color-teal-base: \#54BFA5;  
  \--color-teal-dark: \#1C5F56;  
  \--color-gold:      \#E9C559;
